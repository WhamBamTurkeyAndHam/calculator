After finishing this, I felt a lot more confident with being able to work with each section, HTML, CSS and JS.

I was pleased with how quick I was able to put the CSS together, in both how each item fell into place, and in a way that I think looks aesthetic. I also found certain parts of the JS to have a simple solution I learnt somewhere within The Odin Project, while some parts were more of a challenge and required more time thinking over, which made the project fun and satisfying.

In the future I would like to come back to this so I can add more buttons, like a % option, or a + - option, or even things like !. And in adding more buttons, I would then like to try and get the calculator to use BEDMAS, and then display those numbers with commas. The reason I didn't do all of these this time was due to not knowing how to do it, and when I looked it up, I found myself falling into a rabbit hole. So I figured it was best to just push this to main and call it solved... for now.
